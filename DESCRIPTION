Description: Perform a regression analysis, generate a regression table, create a scatter plot, and download the results. It uses 'stargazer' for generating regression tables and 'ggplot2' for creating plots. With just two lines of code, you can perform a regression analysis, visualize the results, and save the output. It is part of my make R easy project where one doesn't need to know how to use various packages in order to get results and makes it easily accessible to beginners. This is a part of my make R easy project. Help from 'ChatGPT' was taken. References were Wickham (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4>.
